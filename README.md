# Boardoza MQ4 Methane Gas Sensor Breakout Board
The MQ4 gas sensor is used for detecting methane (CH4) and natural gas in the air. It belongs to the MQ sensor series, which are designed to detect various gases by utilizing a chemical reaction that occurs on the surface of a heated metal oxide. The MQ4 specifically targets methane, making it an essential tool for safety in environments where natural gas is present, such as in homes, industrial sites, and mines.

## Key Features
- Gas Detection: Primarily detects methane (CH4) and natural gas concentrations in the air.
- High Sensitivity and Fast Response: Responsively detects even small changes in methane concentration.
- Wide Detection Range: Can measure concentrations from approximately 200 parts per million (ppm) to 10,000 ppm.
- Analog and Digital Outputs: Provides both types of outputs; the analog output gives a continuous voltage that correlates with the gas concentration, while the digital output switches when a threshold is reached.
